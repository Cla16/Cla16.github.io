<div class="blurb">
	<h1> Who are you?</h1>
	<p> I am a 3rd Chemical Engineering (graduating in 2021) student at the University of Waterloo.</p>
        <h1> What are you interested in?</h1>
	<p> I have a wide variety of both personal and professional interests!</p>
	<p> Professional: Vehicle Aerodynamics, Generative Design, Automation, and Security.</p>
	<p> Personal: Strategy Games, Bouldering, Reading Biographies, and Philosophizing.</p>
	<h1> What is the point of this website?</h1>
	<p> I have a few goals in mind here: </p>
	<p> 1. Provide a portfolio of my projects and accomplishments to prospective employers </p>
	<p> 2. Provide myself with a platform to write about topics that interest me (probably a mix of strategy games, things I'm working on, and philosophy)</p>
	<p> 3. Give myself an outlet for creative and free form writing going into the New Year. I figure if I set this up now, I won't be able to use the no platform excuse</p>
	<h1> You've interested me. How can I contact you? </h1>
	<p> My email is available at the bottom of each page of this website. As well, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/crvandenhoven/)</p>
